Travels

I have had many amazing travels throughout my life. Rather than share several, I Will share my most recent - which is also my most significant. On Saturday February 12th 2022, my then girlfriend and I got engaged on a trip to her home state of Florida. It will always be one of the most important and amazing trips of my life for that one reason.

Interestingly enough, it was on the flight back to Denver that I decided I wanted to pursue a career change into software engineering.

It was a pretty life changing trip!
