Motivations For Career change

 There are several motivations surrounding my desire to change/enter a career.

 I graduated university May 2020 and found myself (like many other people) not sure what my job prospects were going to be. I ended up on unemployment until being able to return to work as a climbing coach in Denver, CO that September.

 I considered turning my love of climbing and experience as a climbing coach into a career that would work with the life my fiance and I are trying to build. But I wasn't happy with that as a career option for several reasons, which are my main motivations for choosing Turing & software engineering in general into my career.

 Motivation 1) Being able to financially support my future family.

 Motivation 2) Being able to work remote. Which will allow me to be around our home and kids a lot.

 Motivation 3) To have a career that will challenge me intellectually and professionally.
