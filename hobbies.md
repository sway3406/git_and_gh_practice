My Hobbies

My number hobby is climbing. I have worked as a climbing coach for the past 5+ years while finishing my BA. I will be leaving coaching climbers to become a FEE.

A second hobby of mine is all things food. Before beginning collage I was an executive chef and I still currently work as a private chef. I am very fascinated with every aspect of food. From seed table and all of the gears in between.

A third hobby of mine is conservation biology/compost science & bird conservation. I focused on these two specialities in college.

A final hobby I enjoy, but haven't dedicated as much time to lately is mathematics. This was my minor and I worked as a TA for several years at university. I really enjoy working on math problems and also teaching/tutoring mathematics.
